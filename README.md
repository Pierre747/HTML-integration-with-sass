# HTML integration with Sass ✨


My third HTML integration using a blueprint of two different results that would respectively fits :

 - The Browser

 - A Smartphone


The blueprints are available in the folder :

```bash
assets > sketch > ...
```

The goal was to work with Sass to create various style sheets, connect them, interact with pseudo classes and create simple keyframes in order to produce a simple responsive integration.
